## â–¼ Overview
Super simple game where a player can get points by dragging balls onto a basket in limited time.

## â–¼ Tools
    Python 3.7.3
    Tkinter 8.6
    pytest 6.2.5

## â–¼ GUI
GUI library Tikinter has various widgets to display GUI, and this time I used the following:  
- **Button**  
Forming the ball objects and the start button.

- **Label**  
Writing the score board on the right and the text of "Basket" at the center.

- **Canvas**  
Drawing the game field and the oval design of a basket.

## â–¼ Principal Objects
The application has the six classes that are interactive with each other to assure its functionality as game.
### Application Class :
Top-hierarchy class to create the GUI window and instance objects of game and game handler.

    class Application(tk.Tk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Application window
        self.geometry(f"{WINDOW_W}x{WINDOW_H}")
        self.title("Ball-toss game")
        self.create_game()

    # Create game objects
    def create_game(self):
        GameHandler(self, BallTossGame(self))

### GameHandler Class :
Controls the game flow such as ...  
ãƒ»providing a start button for a player to start a game   
ãƒ»handling processes as a game starts  
ãƒ»handling processes as a game ends  
ãƒ»manipulating the state of a start button  

    class GameHandler():
    def __init__(self, root, game):
        self.root = root
        self.game = game

        # Start button
        self.btn = tk.Button(root, text='START', command = self.game_start)
        self.btn.place(x = BOARD_X, y = WINDOW_H/8)

    # Start a game after clicking a start button
    def game_start(self):
        self.game_btn_toggle()
        self.game.game_reset()
        self.game.ball_create()
        self.game.timer_start()
        self.root.after(10000, self.game_end)

    # Operation after a game has finished
    def game_end(self):
        self.game_btn_toggle()
        self.game.ball_destroy()

    # Switch activeness of a start button
    def game_btn_toggle(self):
        if self.btn["state"] == "normal":
            self.btn["state"] = "disable"
        else:
            self.btn["state"] = "normal"

### BallTossGame Class :
Supplies componential sources for game such as ...  
ãƒ»score board that shows the total score and remainding time  
ãƒ»game field where a user can have effects on game  
ãƒ»balls which are actually manipulated by a player   
Methods such as ...  
ãƒ»creating balls  
ãƒ»deleting balls  
ãƒ»starting a timer  
ãƒ»reseting a score board, field, and balls (this trigers deleting balls)

    class BallTossGame():
    # global TIME
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.board = ScoreBoard(root)
        self.canvas = CanvasField(root)
        self.balls = []  # Ball instances go in

    # Create a ball instance
    def ball_create(self):
        for i in range(5):
            ball = Ball(self.root)
            self.balls.append(ball)

    # Delete all ball instances
    def ball_destroy(self):
        for ball in self.balls:
            ball.destroy()
        self.balls.clear()

    # Start a timer
    def timer_start(self):
        self.root.after(1000, self.board.update_time)

    # Reset info of the game point, time, and score board and direct deletion of balls
    def game_reset(self):
        global GAME_POINT, TIME
        GAME_POINT = 0
        TIME = 10
        self.board.score["text"] = f"Score : {GAME_POINT}"
        self.board.timer["text"] = f"Time : {TIME}s"
        self.ball_destroy()

### ScoreBoard Class :
Where a player checks the total score and remaining time.  
Has the methods to update the above things as time elapses.

    class ScoreBoard():
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.score = tk.Label(root, font = ("System", 16), text = f"Score : {GAME_POINT}")
        self.score.place(x = BOARD_X, y = WINDOW_H/4)
        self.timer = tk.Label(root, font = ("System", 16), text = f"Time : {TIME}s")
        self.timer.place(x = BOARD_X, y = WINDOW_H/3)

        # ButtonRelease-1 = left click
        root.bind("<ButtonRelease-1>", self.update_score)

    # Update a score board
    def update_score(self, evnt):
        self.score["text"] = f"Score : {GAME_POINT}"

    # Update timer and a time board
    def update_time(self):
        global TIME
        TIME -= 1
        self.timer["text"] = f"Time : {TIME}s"
        if TIME == 0:
            return
        self.root.after(1000, self.update_time)

### CanvasField Class :
Provides an area where a user plays a game.
At the center of the area, a basket is drawn.

    class CanvasField(tk.Canvas):
    def __init__(self, root):
        # Set up a canvas
        super().__init__(
            root, width=CANVAS_W, height=CANVAS_H, bg="black"
        )
        self.place(x = 0, y = 0)

        # Draw a basket field in a canvas
        self.create_oval(
            BASKET_X, BASKET_Y,
            BASKET_X+BASKET_W, BASKET_Y+BASKET_W,
            fill = "Red"
        )

        # "Basket" at the center
        self.lbl_basket = tk.Label(root, font = ("System", 16), text = "Basket", foreground='White', background='Red')
        self.lbl_basket.place(x = BASKET_X+(BASKET_W/2-27), y = BASKET_Y+(BASKET_W/2-11))

### Ball Class :
Generates an instance which a player, except a start button, actually handles during a game.
This has three object-locating methods trigerred to process when clicking, dragging, and releasing occur, and each bases on the object's begining spot and distance between end and start points of a cursor in order to calculate its landing point.  
Also, in accordance with the landing point, the **ball_evaluate** method examines whether the dropped ball is out of the field, or onto the basket leading to addition of a score.

    class Ball(tk.Button):
    def __init__(self, root):
        super().__init__(
            root, text = 'ball', width = 1, height = 2, font=("", 10)
        )
        self.mouse_xy = None  # coordinates of a cursor
        self.xy = None        # coordinates of a ball
        self.ball_place()

        # Event handlers for clicking, moving, and releasing a ball
        self.bind("<Button-1>", self.ball_click)
        self.bind("<B1-Motion>", self.ball_move)
        self.bind("<ButtonRelease-1>", self.ball_stop)

    # Randomly locate the first position of a ball in a canvas field without overlapping a basket
    def ball_place(self):
        num = r.randint(0, 1)
        num2 = r.randint(2, 3)
        if num == 0:
            x = r.randint(10, CANVAS_W - 40)
            if num2 == 2:
                y = r.randint(10, BASKET_Y - 40)
            else:
                y = r.randint(BASKET_Y + BASKET_W, CANVAS_H - 40)
        else:
            if num2 == 2:
                x = r.randint(10, BASKET_X - 40)
            else:
                x = r.randint(BASKET_X + BASKET_W, CANVAS_W - 40)
            y = r.randint(10, CANVAS_H-40)
        self.place(x = x, y = y)

    # Detect cordinates of a ball and a cursor
    def ball_click(self, evnt):
        self.mouse_xy = (evnt.x_root, evnt.y_root)
        place_info = evnt.widget.place_info()
        ball_x = int(place_info['x'])
        ball_y = int(place_info['y'])
        self.xy = (ball_x, ball_y)
        print(self.xy)

    def ball_move(self, evnt):
        # Distance between coordinates of a mouse after moved and those at origin
        dst = (evnt.x_root - self.mouse_xy[0], evnt.y_root - self.mouse_xy[1])

        # Coordinates of a ball at origin + moving distance
        place_info = evnt.widget.place_info()
        place_info['x'] = self.xy[0] + dst[0]
        place_info['y'] = self.xy[1] + dst[1]
        evnt.widget.place_configure(place_info)

    # Inittialize coordinates
    def ball_stop(self, evnt):
        self.ball_evaluate(evnt)
        self.mouse_xy = None
        self.xy = None

    # Evaluate a spot where a ball has been dropped down
    def ball_evaluate(self, evnt):
        global GAME_POINT

        # Get coordinates of a ball
        place_info = evnt.widget.place_info()
        ball_x = int(place_info["x"])
        ball_y = int(place_info["y"])

        # Whether a ball is outside canvas?
        if ((ball_x < 0)
        or (ball_y < 0)
        or (CANVAS_W < ball_x + BALL_W)
        or (CANVAS_H < ball_y + BALL_W)):
            self.ball_place()

        # Whether a ball is in a basket?
        elif ((BASKET_X < ball_x)
        and (ball_x+BALL_W < BASKET_X+BASKET_W)
        and (BASKET_Y < ball_y)
        and (ball_y+BALL_W < BASKET_Y+BASKET_W)):
            self.ball_place()
            GAME_POINT += 1

## â–¼ Tests
Some tests have been set up for checking initial properties for instances from each class and thier methods.  
In terms of tetsting methodology, pytest helped test above things using **assert** statement that evaluates validity of conditional statements.

## â–¼ Contribution
Contributions on this project were all by myself due to unfotutnately failing to make a group in Discord ðŸ˜¿
